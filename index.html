                    <p> A video game or computer game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface or input device – such as a joystick,
                         controller, keyboard, or motion sensing device – to generate visual feedback.<br><br>
                         The first video game prototypes in the 1950s and 1960s are simple extensions of electronic games using video-like output from large room-size computers.<br>
                        The first consumer video game is the arcade video game Computer Space in 1971.<br>
                        This feedback is shown on a video display device, such as a TV set, monitor, touchscreen, or virtual reality headset.<br><br>
                         Video games are defined based on their platform, which include arcade video games, console games, and personal computer (PC) games.<br>
                        More recently, the industry has expanded onto mobile gaming through smartphones and tablet computers, virtual and augmented reality systems, and remote cloud gaming.<br><br>
                         Video games are classified into a wide range of genres based on their type of gameplay and purpose.</p>

                        Esports, short for electronic sports, is a form of competition using video games.
                        Esports often takes the form of organized, multiplayer video game competitions, particularly between professional players,
                        individually or as teams.<br><br>
                        Although organized competitions have long been a part of video game culture, these were largely between amateurs until the late 2000s,
                        when participation by professional gamers and spectatorship in these events through live streaming saw a large surge in popularity.
                        The most common video game genres associated with esports are multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA),
                        first-person shooter (FPS), fighting, card, battle royale and real-time strategy (RTS) games. 
                        Popular esports franchises include League of Legends, Dota, Counter-Strike, Valorant, Overwatch, Street Fighter, Super Smash Bros. 
                        and StarCraft, among many others.<br><br>
                        Tournaments such as the League of Legends World Championship, Dota 2's International, the fighting game-specific Evolution Championship
                        Series (EVO) and Intel Extreme Masters are among the most popular in esports</p>
